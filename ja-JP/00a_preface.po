msgid "Many professionals are increasingly embracing Debian GNU/Linux, whose goal to create a rich and flexible distribution that does not require too much maintenance fits their expectations. They generally appreciate its robustness and reliability, its automation of secondary tasks, as well as the coherence brought by the strict application of specifications and therefore the durability of achievements and skills."
msgstr "多くの専門家たちは，彼らの期待に合わせるための管理を必要としないリッチで柔軟なディストリビューションを作ることを目標としたDebian GNU/Linuxを採用しています．彼らは一般に屈強さと堅牢性，二次タスクの自動化，それだけでなく仕様の厳格な適用による首尾一貫性，それゆえの成果と巧妙な耐久性を評価しています．"

msgid "At the same time, many influential actors in the computing industry have now come to understand the strategic interest of using an elaborate distribution that is not managed by a commercial entity. Some of their customers also understand — following the same logic — that a software platform that does not depend on agreements between suppliers reduces the constraints they will have after the purchase."

have now come to understand the strategic interest of using an elaborate distribution that is not managed by a commercial entity.

 Some of their customers also understand — following the same logic — that a software platform that does not depend on agreements between suppliers reduces the constraints they will have after the purchase."

msgid "Debian — which used to be low-profile — was first adopted by passionate users, who were often attracted by the spirit it embodies. They found a project with clear goals and visible achievements, whose developers focus on creating a good design <emphasis>before</emphasis> building — thereby rejecting the deadlines that often compromise the quality of so many other software projects. Debian is led by its very actors. In other words, Debian users join a project that fully benefits from the advantages of free software… so as to produce free software themselves."

msgid "The <citetitle>Debian Administrator's Handbook</citetitle> will guide you on your way to autonomy. It could only be written by authors who master both the technical aspects and the inner workings of the Debian project, and who know the needs of seasoned professionals as well as enthusiasts. Raphaël Hertzog and Roland Mas had the required qualities and managed to create and update this book. I thank them very much for their work and have no doubt that reading this book will be both helpful and pleasant."
